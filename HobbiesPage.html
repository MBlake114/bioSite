            <p>What is crochet?  Well the general idea is to use hooks (of varying sizes), a ball of wool/yarn, some scissors, and a plan to create almost anything you can think of.
                Echo has created a ton of really unique items including the above images.  Crochet is a really great way to express creative and can even be a cathartic stress relief.  
                Here is a great website to learn more about crochet: <a href = "https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-to-crochet-for-beginners-979092" target = "_blank">www.thesprucecrafts.com</a>
