            <p>	Echo Gonino was born at Fort Carson, Colorado to Jeffery and Shannon Blake.  Echo and family moved to a small town in Iowa where she grew up and went to school.  Echo lived on a small family farm for most of her life.  Growing up in a small town was difficult at times but there were fun times too including family vacations to the Rocky Mountains.  A particular favorite destination was Colorado Springs where Echo's maternal grandparents lived.  Echo also learned how to crochet from her mother, a hobby that would continue to fascinate her throughout her life.  She has created many amazing crochet designs for her friends and family.  Echo was very involved in extra curricular activities including Cross-Country running and theater productions.  Echo excelled at school work and graduated with a 4.0 GPA from High School.  
                After graduating High School Echo moved away to go to a university.  Echo had her first child Jasper and started working at a software product consultation company.  Eventually she worked her way up to product owner where she manages a team of software developers.  Echo wants to eventually work her way up to product manager so that she has more influence over the entire products development.  In the future Echo would like to transition away from her company to work for a non-profit so that she could give back to the community/world.  Echo wants to make sure she can provide for her family and to help other people to the best of her ability so that people can have a good life.  </p>
